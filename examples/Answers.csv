Lithium (Li) is the lightest of the alkali metals.
Sodium (Na) is the sixth most abundant element in the Earth's crust.
"Sodium (Na) is used as a reducing agent in the production of various metals, including titanium, zirconium, and tantalum."
"Rubidium is used in atomic clocks due to its precise atomic resonance frequency, which is used as a reference for timekeeping."
"Lithium is used in nuclear fusion reactions as a source of tritium, a key component in hydrogen bombs and fusion reactors."
Lithium has the highest electronegativity among the alkali metals.
Alkali metals are excellent conductors of electricity and heat due to their highly mobile valence electrons.
"Francium (Fr) is the heaviest and most unstable of the alkali metals, with an extremely short half-life of only 22 minutes, and is primarily used in scientific research."
"Alkali metals should be handled in an inert atmosphere or liquid, such as mineral oil or an inert gas, to prevent oxidation and potential fires or explosions."
The high reactivity and limited availability of alkali metals pose challenges in their widespread use.
