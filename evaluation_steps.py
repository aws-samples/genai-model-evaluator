The language used is generally clear, although there may be some instances of ambiguity or confusing phrasing that could benefit from improvement. The main ideas and key details from the source text are conveyed accurately for the most part, but there may be a few points that lack complete clarity or risk misinterpretation. Complex concepts or technical terms are adequately explained, but some additional clarification may be needed. The summary may contain some unnecessary jargon or overly complex language that could hinder understanding for some readers.

2 - Fair Clarity:
The summary demonstrates fair clarity and comprehensibility. The language used is often unclear or ambiguous, with multiple instances of confusing phrasing that hinder understanding. The main ideas and key details from the source text are partially conveyed, but there are several points that lack clarity or risk misinterpretation. Complex concepts or technical terms are insufficiently explained, leaving room for confusion or misunderstanding. The summary contains a significant amount of unnecessary jargon or overly complex language that may impede comprehension for the target audience.

1 - Poor Clarity:
The summary exhibits poor clarity and comprehensibility. The language used is frequently unclear, ambiguous, or confusing, making it difficult to understand the main ideas and key details. The summary fails to accurately convey the core information from the source text, with numerous points lacking clarity or being misinterpreted. Complex concepts or technical terms are poorly explained or left unexplained, leading to confusion and misunderstanding. The summary is riddled with unnecessary jargon or overly complex language, significantly hindering comprehension for the target audience.

0 - Unacceptable Clarity:
The summary lacks any discernible clarity or comprehensibility. The language used is incomprehensible, with severe ambiguity and confusing phrasing throughout. The summary fails to convey the main ideas and key details from the source text accurately, rendering it meaningless or entirely unrelated to the original content. Complex concepts or technical terms are either absent or explained in an utterly confusing manner. The summary is filled with excessive jargon and overly complex language, making it impossible for the target audience to understand.

Objectivity:
- Does the summary present information objectively, without introducing personal biases, opinions, or judgments not present in the source text?
- Are subjective statements or claims in the source text accurately represented in the summary, without exaggeration or diminishment?
- Is the language used in the summary neutral and impartial, avoiding loaded or emotionally charged words that could influence the reader's perception?

5 - Excellent:
Objectivity: The summary presents information from the source text in an entirely objective and impartial manner. It accurately reflects the content, tone, and multiple perspectives (if present) without introducing personal biases, opinions, or judgments. The language used is neutral and factual, devoid of loaded or emotionally charged words that could sway the reader's perception.

4 - Very Good:
Objectivity: The summary maintains a high degree of objectivity, accurately representing the content and tone of the source text without significant bias or personal opinions.

There are no major factual errors or misrepresentations.

3 - Good:
Objectivity: The summary generally presents information objectively, but there are occasional instances of subjective language, personal opinions, or biases that are not present in the source text.

Objectivity: The summary displays a lack of objectivity, with frequent instances of subjective language, personal opinions, and biases not present in the source text. Multiple perspectives may be presented, but one viewpoint is clearly favored or dismissed. There are some factual errors or misrepresentations of information from the source text that impact the accuracy of the summary.

1 - Poor:
Objectivity: The summary is highly subjective and biased, with a significant portion of the content reflecting personal opinions, judgments, or exaggerations not present in the source text. Multiple perspectives are either not represented or are unfairly dismissed or misrepresented. There are numerous factual errors or misrepresentations of information from the source text, leading to a distorted or inaccurate summary.

    Given the following CSV data on AI model performance:

    {csv_string}

    Please analyze the data and determine which model has the best performance in terms of cost efficiency and speed.
    
    'Total Cost(1000)' is the total cost in dollars for invoking the model 1000 times.
    'Time Length' is the time to invoke the model.
    'Summary Score' is the invoke response quality score.

    Criteria for evaluation:
    1) The model with the lowest 'Total Cost(1000)' is considered as least expensive. 
    2) The model with the highest 'Total Cost(1000)' is considered as most expensive.
    3) The model with the shortest 'Time Length' is considered as fastest.
    4) The model with the highest 'Summary Score' is considered as best summary result.
    4) The model with the lowest 'Summary Score' is considered as worse summary result.

    Summarize your findings on which model performs best on each criterion and overall. Identify the percent time and cost difference.
